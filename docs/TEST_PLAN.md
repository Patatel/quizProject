# Test Plan

This document describes the testing strategy for the **quizProject** application. The goal is to ensure that all key features work as expected and that the codebase remains maintainable over time.

## 1. Objectives
- Validate that all functionalities operate correctly.
- Provide a repeatable environment for running tests.
- Ensure that results of executed tests match expected outcomes.
- Consider technology evolution and security concerns in test cases.

## 2. Test Environment
- **PHP**: version 8.1 or above.
- **Web Server**: built-in PHP development server (`php -S localhost:8000`).
- **Database**: MySQL or MariaDB instance for development.
- **Node.js**: used for JavaScript tooling (linting).
- **GitHub Actions**: CI environment that runs on every push or pull request.

The repository includes a workflow (`.github/workflows/php-lint.yml`) that installs PHP and checks syntax of all PHP files. This workflow can be extended with additional steps (e.g., PHPUnit, ESLint) as the project evolves.

## 3. Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: cover controllers and models. Use `phpunit` for PHP classes and Jest (or similar) for JavaScript modules.
- **Integration Tests**: verify API endpoints through HTTP requests.
- **End‑to‑End Tests**: simulate user interactions in the browser with a tool like Cypress.
- **Security Tests**: ensure authentication, authorization, and input validation work as intended.

## 4. Features to Test
| Feature | Tests |
| ------- | ----- |
| **User Registration** | Valid registration, duplicate email, invalid input |
| **User Login** | Successful login, wrong password, nonexistent user |
| **Quiz Management** | Create quiz, update quiz, delete quiz, list user quizzes |
| **Question Management** | Add questions, update questions, delete question |
| **Taking Quizzes** | Retrieve quiz questions, submit answers, calculate score |
| **Results** | Fetch user results, view detailed answers |

Each test case should assert expected HTTP status codes, returned JSON structures, and correct database modifications.

## 5. Execution and Expected Results
- Tests are executed locally with `phpunit` and `npm test` once they are set up.
- Continuous Integration runs the same test suites in GitHub Actions.
- Results must match expected outcomes defined in the individual test cases. Failures are investigated and resolved before merging changes.

## 6. Maintenance and Evolution
- Review the test plan periodically to accommodate new features or updates in PHP and JavaScript ecosystems.
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that tests cover known security concerns such as SQL injection, XSS, and privilege escalation.
